The tests in this directory are described using JSON and shared
between the server and any clients wishing to implement consistent
operation transforms.

By default, the tests should be run using the order in the INDEX.txt
file - this is the suggested order to write an implementation against.
If a test file is not listed in INDEX.txt, it should be ignored.
